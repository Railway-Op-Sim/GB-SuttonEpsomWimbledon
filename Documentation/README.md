# Sutton, Epsom and Wimbledon

Sutton, Epsom and Wimbledon covers South-West London and a small part of Surrey. The area contains a large amount of commuter services to and from several London terminii.

## Simulation

The included timetable is based on the London Victoria closures which occured during December into early January. This means that some services will terminate at different stations that usual, but as far as I can tell there has been no changes to the actual service patterns.

Despite the size of the route, it is relatively easy to operate, and a session is included with many automatic routes set to aid in operation.

A further fictional timetable is in production for this route, but it will be released at a later stage.

## Development

This project is open for contributions on the ROS GitHub organistations. If you would like to improve or add to this route, feel free to do so [here.](https://github.com/Railway-Op-Sim/GB-SuttonEpsomWimbledon)
